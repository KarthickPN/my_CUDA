# my_CUDA

This is my first foray into the world of GPU programming.  I am attempting to learn some advanced concepts in Engineering, and GPU programming has always been on my bucket list. Since I deal with a lot of Image Processing and Robotics software development, I would really love to take advantage of GPU's massive processing power.  This repository will contain my entire CUDA journey, from Hello World to mini projects.
